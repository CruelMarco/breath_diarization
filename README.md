# breath_diarization
This repository is for codes to perform segmentation of breath sound signals using diarization technique. Inhale and Exhale parts of the breath signals are treated as two different speakers in order to apply standard diarization techniques to extract inhale and exhale boundaries.

The code consists of both supervised and unsupervised learnings.
